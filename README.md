# creditcardfrauddetection
Credit Card Fraud Detection is a typical example of classification. In this process, we have focused more on analyzing the feature modeling and possible business use cases of the algorithm’s output than on the algorithm itself. We used the implementation of Binomial Logistic Regression Algorithm in the ‘ROCR’ package on the PCA transformed Credit Card Fraud data.
